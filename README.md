## Synopsis

This is a clone of [org-roam by Jethro
Kuan](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam) and other contributors. 
It's adapted to support markdown files in parallel with org files.
It currently supports (hard coded) `.md` extension only.
In order to enable the backlinks in the way of org-roam, the org's link syntax
needs to be used within the markdown files. I suggest to use:
  `org-roam-insert-link (C-c n i)`

Important links:

- **[Documentation][docs]**
- **[Org-roam Slack][slack]**

## Installation

The recommended method is using use-package and straight, or a similar package manager.

```emacs-lisp
(use-package org-roam
      :hook 
      (after-init . org-roam-mode)
      :straight (:host github :repo "jethrokuan/org-roam")
      :custom
      (org-roam-directory "/path/to/org-files/")
      :bind (:map org-roam-mode-map
              (("C-c n l" . org-roam)
               ("C-c n f" . org-roam-find-file)
               ("C-c n g" . org-roam-show-graph))
              :map org-mode-map
              (("C-c n i" . org-roam-insert))))
```
